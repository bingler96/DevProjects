# These lists are extremely powerful and have alot of applications in data science and machine learning
# In math we have a concept called matrix, which is like a rectangular array of numbers

#matrix = [
    #[1, 2, 3], # This is the rectangular array of numbers | 3x3 matrix in math | we model this in python by the 2D list, which is each item in that list is another list 
    #[4, 5, 6],
    #[7, 8, 9]
#]
#for row in matrix:
    #for item in row: # This will output all the numbers in this list 
        #print(item)


matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
matrix [0] [1] = 20 # This modifying the matrix it will change the first row number 2 to 20 
print(matrix[1] [1]) # The first square bracket accesses the first row being [1, 2, 3] & the 2nd [] is the index so this example it will return 5, Its accessing the second list and the 1st index being 5
